An in-house metrics platform that offers, among other things, a centralised and participative source of truth for analytics, reporting and experimentation across the company.

Marketing might calculate it one way, the product team another, leading to a battle of conflicting dashboards and eroding trust in the data itself. This is precisely the chaos that a centralised metrics platform like Mercury was designed to tame.

By creating a single, governed source of truth for business logic, a metrics store ensures that when anyone asks a question about the data, they get one consistent, reliable answer.

The abstractions of metrics from the end user seems to be achieved through two **layers of definitions** (config files) that, starting from origin data, are used to build a **unified metric layer** by providing instructions on how to query the underlying data.
