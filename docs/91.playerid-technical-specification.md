# EternalPlayerID Technical Specification v1.0  

**For Legal + DPO Sign-Off – Phase 0 Gate #2**  
**Status: READY FOR APPROVAL**  
**Deadline: Wednesday 10 December 2025, 17:00**

### 1. Purpose (Why this exists – in plain language for Legal)

We must **permanently stop any raw personal identifier** (device ID, advertising ID, email, phone, IP, etc.) from ever leaving a player’s device or our servers in telemetry or logs.  
The EternalPlayerID is the **only identifier** that may travel with events — it is irreversibly anonymised, salted per-game, rotatable, and supports lawful deletion.

### 2. Legal & Regulatory Compliance Mapping (one-liner per regulation)

| Regulation / Law               | How EternalPlayerID complies                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GDPR Art. 5(1)(c) – Data minimisation | No direct or indirect personal data subject identifier leaves the device                                    |
| GDPR Art. 25 – Privacy by design       | Anonymisation happens at the edge (client + server) before any storage or transmission                  |
| GDPR Art. 17 – Right to be forgotten   | Salt rotation + deletion vector guarantees erasure within 30 days                                        |
| CCPA / CPRA                            | No sale or sharing of personal information — EternalPlayerID is not “personal information”                |
| LGPD (Brazil), PIPL (China), PDPA (Singapore) | All satisfied via same pseudonymisation + deletion guarantees                                      |
| COPPA / GDPR-K (minors <16)            | Special minor flag embedded — no behavioural profiling allowed                                          |

### 3. Technical Design (final – no further changes)

| Item                            | Decision (locked)                                                                                     | Rationale / Legal benefit                                      |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Source identifier               | Raw identifiers we already have today (device ID, advertising ID, account UUID, login tokens, IP)   | All exist today — we are reducing, not adding                  |
| Hashing algorithm               | **HMAC-SHA-256**                                                                                      | NIST-approved, one-way, collision-resistant                    |
| Secret key                      | 256-bit cryptographically random key **per game title** (never shared between titles)              | Prevents cross-game re-identification                          |
| Salt rotation schedule          | New salt every **90 days** + immediate rotation on lawful deletion request                            | Guarantees erasure (old ID becomes unresolvable)               |
| Output format                   | **Base62-encoded 43-character string** (e.g. `A7f9Kb2mX4pL8qW3vT5zY9nR6tJ1cH4eD2gF5hJ8kM`)       | URL-safe, fixed length, no “=” padding                         |
| Minor flag                      | Last character = “m” if player age <16 (or unknown but possible minor)                               | Immediate downstream block for behavioural targeting           |
| Implementation location         | 1. Client SDK (before any event leaves device)<br>2. Server middleware (defensive belt-and-suspenders) | Double protection — if client is compromised, server still anonymises |
| Storage                         | EternalPlayerID is stored everywhere — raw identifiers are **deleted within 24 h** of hashing         | Minimisation + deletion guarantee                              |
| Lawful deletion process         | Player requests deletion → we rotate salt for that game → old EternalPlayerID becomes unresolvable within 24 h | Meets 30-day deletion obligation worldwide                     |

### 4. Example Transformations (real copy-paste from code)

```python
# Before (today – ILLEGAL after Dec 10)
event = {"player_id": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ef-ghij-klmnopqrstuv", ...}

# After (from Dec 10 – ONLY allowed version)
event = {
    "eternal_player_id": "K9xP2mV7qR4tY6nL8zT5cJ1fH3gD6bW9eQ2rF4tA7m",   # <— 42 chars + "m" minor flag
    # NO raw ID, no advertising ID, no IP, no email
}
```
