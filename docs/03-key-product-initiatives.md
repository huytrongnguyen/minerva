|---|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Data Infrastructure Foundation**        | Create a single, real-time, reliable source of truth for all player and marketing events, including simulated data for testing | Lead Data Engineer  | Phase 0–1      | 100 % of live games + sim app sending events ≤ 5 min latency, 99.9 % uptime (tested on 1M simulated players/day) |
| 2  | **Real-Time LTV Modeling**                  | Predict accurate Day-7, Day-30, and Day-180 LTV within hours of install, using predictive signals like D1 retention and first IAP | Head of Data Science| Phase 1 + 3    | ≥ 85 % pLTV D30 accuracy (MAPE ≤ 15 %) on all titles; validated via sim app back-testing |
| 3  | **Campaign Optimization Engine**            | Automatically kill, scale, and bid-adjust campaigns using predicted ROAS, with smart signal strategies for networks like Meta/Google | UA Director + DE    | Phase 2–4      | ≥ 25 % blended ROAS uplift vs 2025 baseline; 70 % decisions automated (e.g., tROAS bidding) |
| 4  | **Unified Dashboard & Live Dashboard**            | Replace all Excel/BI reports with one real-time Tableau source-of-truth, including cohort heatmaps and AARRR funnels | Analytics Lead      | Phase 1–4      | 80 %+ weekly active users (UA/LiveOps/Product) + zero Excel cohort reports; live <5 min refresh |
| 5  | **Personalization & Retention Tools**       | Use pLTV and churn signals to trigger in-game offers, dynamic pricing, and re-engagement campaigns for whale rescue | LiveOps Manager     | Phase 4 + Q1 2027 | +10 % D30 retention on treated whale/at-risk segments; 60 % churn rescue rate via AI offers |
| 6  | **Governance, Scalability & Compliance**    | Ensure the platform is secure, auditable, and scales to 10× current volume, with model drift detection and privacy-safe federation | Data Platform Lead  | All phases     | GDPR/CCPA compliant + automated model monitoring + drift alerts; supports 20+ titles cross-studio |
| 7 | **Simulation & Testing Engine**             | Build a production-grade simulator for realistic event generation, UA scenario planning, and regression testing across all phases | Full-Stack Dev + DS | Phase 0–4 + Q1 2027 | 1M concurrent simulated players in <10 min; used in 100 % game updates for pre-launch validation; +20 % faster iteration cycles |
| 8 | **AI Innovation & Expansion**               | Evolve to generative LiveOps (auto-events/offers), cross-game LTV passports, and white-label licensing for external studios | CTO + Product       | Q4 2026 – Q4 2027 | Launch 1 white-label version to 5 external studios; +18 % ARPU from dynamic pricing; $3–8 M ARR from licensing |
